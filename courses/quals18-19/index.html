<h1>Computer Science PhD Qualifier Exam: Data, Information, Knowledge, and Libraries</h1>

<h2 id="Committee">Committee</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://berthuang.com">Bert Huang</a> (Chair)</li>
  <li><a href="http://people.cs.vt.edu/~jiepu/">Jiepu Jiang</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://people.cs.vt.edu/~shaffer/">Cliff Shaffer</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="instructions">Tentative Instructions</h2>

<p>These instructions are subject to change as we form our exam committee and incorporate their ideas.</p>

<ul>
    <li>All students must register via email to the chair (Bert Huang).</li>
    <li>At the beginning of the examination period, all students will receive a document that contains questions.</li>
    <li>By the end of the examination period, each student must turn in a written solution to one of those questions. The solutions will be no longer than 8 pages (excluding references) at 11 point font or larger using a format TBA.</li>
    <li>Written solutions should take the form of a scientific paper. It should include at least the following:
        <ul>
            <li>a motivation section making clear the context of the problem/situation;</li>
            <li>a clear statement of the problem in terms of concepts and terminology in the information/data area, that addresses the situation/context;</li>
            <li>a review of related literature, drawn partially from multiple relevant works in the reading list, but must include additional references found by the student during a thorough literature search;</li>
            <li>descriptions of approaches to solve the problem; and</li>
            <li>an evaluation plan for how such approaches would be validated.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Students will then provide an oral presentation detailing their solution. They must be completed within a 15 minute period, in which 12 minutes are for presentation and 3 minutes for answering questions posed by faculty examiners.</li>
    <li>Each solution will be graded by at least 2 faculty members. A combined grade will then be assigned for each student based on all faculty input by the area committee, on a scale of 0-3, as is called for by GPC policies.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="students">Registered Students</h2>

    <li>Anika Tabassum</li>
    <li>Xinyue Wang</li>
    <li>Karim Youssef</li>
    <li>Lei Zhang</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="withdrawal">Early Withdrawal Policy</h2>

<p>Once students have notified the Computer Science Department of their intention to take the Data, Information, Knowledge, and Libraries (DIKL) Ph.D. Qualifier Exam, they may withdraw from taking the exam at any point prior to the public release of the exam questions. Once the exam questions are released, the exam is considered "in progress" and withdrawal is prohibited. Students with questions about this policy should contact the exam chair directly.</p>

<h2 id="integrity">Academic Integrity</h2>

<p>Discussions among students of the papers identified for the DIKL Qualifier are reasonable up until the date the exam is released publicly. Once the exam questions are released, we expect all such discussions will cease as students are required to conduct their own work entirely to answer the qualifier questions. This examination is conducted under the University's Graduate Honor System Code. Students are encouraged to draw from other papers than those listed in the exam to the extent that this strengthens their arguments. However, the answers submitted must represent the sole and complete work of the student submitting the answers. Material substantially derived from other works, whether published in print or found on the web, must be explicitly and fully cited. Note that your grade will be more strongly influenced by arguments you make rather than arguments you quote or cite.</p>

<h2 id="schedule">Exam Schedule</h2>

<ul>
<li>12/07/2018: release of reading list</li>
<li>12/12/2018: last day to register for exam</li>
<li>01/04/2019: written exam released; last day to withdraw</li>
<li>01/18/2019: student solutions to written exam due</li>
<li>TBA: oral exam</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="exam">Exam Questions</h2>

<p>The exam questions are available here: <a href="http://berthuang.com/courses/quals18-19/DIKL_exam_2019.pdf">http://berthuang.com/courses/quals18-19/DIKL_exam_2019.pdf</a>.</p>

<h2 id="reading">Reading List</h2>

<p>For this qualifying exam, you have two options for reading lists. You may (1) read and expand on a suggest list that we provide here, or (2) create your own reading list. </p>

<p>If you choose to use one of these suggested lists, you are responsible for expanding these lists to <b>at least 20</b> papers around a central topic. Your expanded list should include older, seminal papers about core ideas and recent, state-of-the-art papers. </p>

<p>You are also welcome to create your own reading list on a topic not listed here relevant to data, information, knowledge, or libraries, but that reading list must be approved by your research advisor. Whether you are creating your own list or building your full list from
the sample starter lists, you should begin reading and adding papers to your list immediately
so you are ready to respond to the exam questions in January.</p>

<p>The reading list and qualifying exam topic are not intended to necessarily be your dissertation topic. But you are welcome to make the two overlap if desired. Instead, you will be expected to reason about, write about, and conduct literature search on, and present this topic to demonstrate your ability to conduct doctorate research.</p>

<h2>Grading Scale</h2>

<p>The exam will ultimately be graded on a scale as detailed in the Ph.D. Student Handbook, as replicated here.</p>

<ol start=0>

<li>Student's performance is such that the committee considers the student unable to do Ph.D.-level work in computer science.</li>
<li>While the student adequately understands the content of the work, the student is deficient in one or more factors listed for assessment under score value of 2. A score of 1 is the minimum necessary for an MS-level pass.</li>
<li>Performance appropriate for students preparing to do Ph.D.-level work. Prime factors for assessment include being able to distinguish good work from poor work, and explain why; being able to synthesize the body of work into an assessment of the state-of-the-art on a problem (as indiciated by the collection of papers); and being able to identify open problems and suggest future work.</li>
<li>Excellent performance, beyond that normally expected or required for a Ph.D. student.</li>
