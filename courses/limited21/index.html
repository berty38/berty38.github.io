        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This course will cover the latest research on machine learning in settings where
          labeled data is not available. In such settings, classical methods are not necessarily the
          best approaches for algorithms to learn from data. Students will lead and participate
          in discussions on recent research publications. Students will also complete a research
          project applying these new methods. In addition to the specific knowledge about the
          topic area, students will also gain experience reading and understanding research
          literature, planning and executing research projects, and communicating about
          machine learning research. </p>

        <p>We will read about ongoing research on how to solve the challenging task of doing
          machine learning with limited labeled data. We will read a lot of papers and try to
          understand the problems they solve and their methods. You will do a mini research
          project during the semester where you either apply an existing method to an
          application you are interested in or work on developing and evaluating new methods.</p>

        <p>The course will take place virtually from 1:30-2:45pm on Mondays and Wednesdays.</p>

        <h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

        <p>Students are expected to have taken COMP 135 or have
          equivalent experience, broadly defined. In other words, students
          in this course should have previously studied machine learning and/or artificial intelligence and basic statistics and probability.</p>

        <p>Please speak with the instructor if you are concerned about your background. Note: If any student needs special accommodations because of any disabilities,
          please contact the instructor during the first week of classes.</p>

        <h3 id="objectives">Learning Objectives</h3>

        <p>A student who successfully completes this class should</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Have a broad perspective on tools for machine learning in settings with limited annotation;</li>
          <li>Gain experience reading and understanding research
            literature;</li>
          <li>Have practiced planning and executing a research project;</li>
          <li>Have practiced communicating about the latest machine learning research.</li>
        </ul>


        <a name="schedule"></a>

        <h3>Schedule</h3>

        <p>The class schedule is available <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSRB8FhhXbWWrQPsCjXAHj3J1J5v2kSrFK-20gUkp0CZc4W3kpdOFXgknZ0SJq7Z-npd6HP-GgiZbw3/pubhtml">here</a> and is embedded below.
          We will update the schedule regularly.</p>

        <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
          <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSRB8FhhXbWWrQPsCjXAHj3J1J5v2kSrFK-20gUkp0CZc4W3kpdOFXgknZ0SJq7Z-npd6HP-GgiZbw3/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;headers=false"></iframe>
        </div>

        <h3 id="summaries">Takeaway Summaries</h3>

        <p>Each student will be required to read the assigned text and submit a summary of the reading before class begins. These summaries should be between four and 10 sentences long,
          covering the important points of the reading. The summaries should not go into fine detail, but they should highlight things you
          believe are important to discuss in class, where we will examine the reading in detail.</p>

        <h3 id="leading">Leading Classes</h3>

        <p>Each student will be required to lead our discussion during one class session during the semester. Class leaders will be responsible for:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Summarizing the reading,</li>
          <li>Discussing questions from the class,</li>
          <li>And leading the class in trying to solve exercises from the reading.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Students are not expected to "teach" the topics from the reading. We will all learn the concepts together as a class.
          Therefore it is okay and encouraged for students to highlight questions or passages in the reading they want help understanding.</p>

        <h3 id="Projects">Projects</h3>

        <p>Students will complete a project during this course. They will be done in groups of size 1, 2, or 3.
          Projects may be one of two types:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><b>Reproduction studies</b>. Take an existing result from a recent paper and attempt to reproduce the result with experimentation or theoretical analysis.</li>
          <li><b>Novel research</b>. Propose and evaluate a new application, algorithm, or theoretical idea.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Broadly speaking, the expectations for course projects is that they
          will include preliminary results. If the results are promising, you
          are encouraged to continue pursuing the research direction, but that
          will not be graded. You are also welcome to incorporate your existing
          research interests into a project.
          More details about project requirements are forthcoming.</p>

        <h3 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h3>

        <p>If any student needs special accommodations because of any disabilities,
          please contact the instructor during the first week of classes. Such students are encouraged to work with
          Tufts' Student Accessibility and Academic Resource Center (<a href="https://students.tufts.edu/staar-center/accessibility-services">https://students.tufts.edu/staar-center/accessibility-services</a>) to help coordinate accessibity
          arrangements.</p>

        <h3 id="gradingscale">Grading</h3>


        <ul>
          <li>10%: Class attendance</li>
          <li>50%: Takeaway summaries</li>
          <li>20%: Project</li>
          <li>20%: Class leading</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Based on the grading breakdown above, each student's final grade
          for the course will be determined by the final percentage of points earned.
          The grade ranges are as follows: </p>

        <table>
          <tr>
            <td><b>A:</b></td>
            <td>93.3%&ndash;100%,</td>
            <td><b>A-:</b></td>

          </tr>
        </table>

        <h3 id="attendance">Class Attendance</h3>

        <p>All students are expected to attend all lectures unless they have given sufficient
          notice for justifiable absences. Absence will be excused for reasons including health needs, conference attendance,
          family emergencies, and job-search interviews.</p>

        <!-- <p>We will take attendance at random to save class time and to encourage attendance by exploiting probability.
          In each class session, we will draw a random whole number (using <a href="http://random.org">random.org</a>) between 1 and 10.
          If that number is <b>1</b>, we will take full-class attendance.
          Thus, for each class you miss without a valid reason, you will be penalized with 0.1 probability.
          In expectation, we will only take attendance two or three times all semester.
          Thus, missing any one of these attendance days could greatly affect your grade.</p> -->

        <p>Retroactive permission will be granted for emergencies if you miss
          class on an attendance day but had a valid reason that you were
          unable to notify about (e.g., health reasons).</p>

        <h3 id="academicintegrity">Academic Integrity</h3>

        <p>Students enrolled in this course are responsible for abiding by the academic integrity code in the Tufts Student Code of Conduct. For additional
          information about the code, please visit:
          <a href="https://students.tufts.edu/student-affairs/student-code-conduct/academic-integrity-resources">https://students.tufts.edu/student-affairs/student-code-conduct/academic-integrity-resources</a>
        </p>

        <p>This course will have a zero-tolerance philosophy regarding plagiarism or other forms of cheating.
          Your homework assignments must be your own group's work, and any external source of code, ideas, or language must be cited to give credit
          to the original source. I am required to report any suspicion of academic misconduct to the
          Dean of Student Affairs Office without warning or discussing with the suspected students.</p>

        <h3 id="community">Standards of Community</h3>

        <p>Because the course will include in-class discussions, we will adhere to Tufts'
          <a href="https://students.tufts.edu/student-affairs/student-code-conduct/iii-standards-tufts-community">Standards of the Tufts Community</a>.
          For class discussions, one principle is most relevant:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          Tufts University students demonstrate respect for themselves, for each other, and for the entire community.
          Respect includes promoting safety of all people and property. It also includes respecting the privacy and autonomy of all community members.
          In both the intellectual and social community, respect transcends disagreement to promote learning and understanding.
        </blockquote>

        <p>The remaining principles are also important, and we will take them seriously as a class.</p>
