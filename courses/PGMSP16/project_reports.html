<h1>Probabilistic Graphical Models and Structured Prediction Project<br>
CS6424/ECE6424 Spring 2016</h1>

<h2 id="project">Project Report</h2>

<p>This page contains some of the papers submitted as final project reports for CS6424/ECE6424 Probabilistic Graphical Models and Structured Prediction in the spring semester of 2016.</p>

<p>The work presented here is done by students on short time constraints, so it may be preliminary or have inconclusive results. I encouraged the students to choose projects that complemented or integrated with their own research, so it is possible the project has continued since this report was submitted. If you are interested in the topic, I encourage you to contact the authors to see the latest developments on these ideas.</p>
